After the incredible part 1 of their cover version EP entitled; 'DO NOT COVER' featured probably the best ever version of Paolo Conte's VIA CON ME, the Italian trio now follow it up swiftly with this gem of a homage to swing music before they return once again with part 2 of their cover version EP later this summer! Got that?\n\nQUEEN OF SWING also features a collaboration with one of London's finest Balkan Brass outfits, GYPSY HILL whom they met backstage at the RUMPUS club one night and the single is every bit the feel-good, summertime floor-filler one would expect from that heritage. Play loud with all the windows open! Enjoy.\n\nOUT NOW on iTunes here: \nJUNO: \n\nMORE from the SWINGROWERS on soundcloud here: \n\nPlease 'follow' us for more music like this, tweet subscribe or share. Thanks.",
